The AI Fake News Detection and News Aggregator is a web-based intelligent system that automatically collects news from online sources, analyzes the credibility of news articles, and classifies them as Real or Fake using state-of-the-art NLP and Machine Learning models.

This project combines news aggregation, AI-based fake news detection, and confidence scoring into a single platform, making it useful for students, researchers, journalists, and the general public.

🎯 Objectives

To detect fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning models

To provide confidence scores and credibility labels

To aggregate and display news articles from multiple online sources

To compare predictions from different models (Admin view)

To build an easy-to-use Flask-based web interface
